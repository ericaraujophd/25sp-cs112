## SLOs for Week 13

At the end of this unit, students will be able to...

-   describe the unique characteristics of the STL set container -- e.g., that a set stores unique values in sorted order.
-   describe the time complexity of set container operations, like find, insert, remove.
-   write code using iterators to traverse all items in a set.
-   explain the behavior of an iterator.
-   describe the unique characteristics of the STL map container -- e.g., that a map stores key, value pairs, with unique keys stored in sorted order.
-   describe the time complexity of map container operations, like find, insert, remove, and indexing/subscripting.
-   reason about the unique behavior of indexing in a map object.
-   write code using iterators to traverse all items in a map.
