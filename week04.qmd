## SLOs for Week 04

Students will be able to...

-   recognize a copy constructor and implement it.
-   identify the 3 situations in which a copy constructor is called
-   reason about the difference between a **shallow** and **deep** copy of a data structure.
-   use the **new** operator to dynamically allocate memory and the **delete** and **delete\[\]** operators to free up the memory.
-   explain when C++ calls the destructor on an object.
-   explain when it is important to implement the destructor explicitly for a class.
-   understand the implementation of a dynamic array data structure, including how it adapts its internal size to accommodate the number of values in the array.
-   implement operator overloading for a class.
