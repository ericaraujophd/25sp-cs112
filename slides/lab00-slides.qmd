## Bible Reflection for a Data Structures Lab Session

**Verse:** *"Let all things be done decently and in order."* — 1 Corinthians 14:40

As we dive into the intricacies of data structures, this verse reminds us of the importance of organization and structure, not just in our code but also in life. Data structures like arrays, trees, and graphs teach us that even the most complex systems can be understood and managed when approached with order and clarity.

God’s creation reflects His intentional design—everything has a purpose and place, from the smallest atom to the vastness of the universe. Similarly, in our programming, we use data structures to bring order to chaos, enabling efficiency and clarity in solving problems.

As we work on today’s lab, let us remember that the discipline and creativity we apply to our work reflect the order and purpose God calls us to embody. Let’s strive to build systems that not only function well but also mirror the excellence and intentionality of our Creator.

**Prayer:**
Lord, thank You for the gift of logic and creativity. Help us to approach our work with diligence and clarity, bringing order to our ideas just as You bring order to all creation. May our efforts in this lab glorify You and serve as a reflection of Your wisdom. Amen.

## Lab 9
