## Introduction

Today, we want to time a few list and vector operations, using the STL list and vector templates. While we have talked in class about "Big Oh" notation, today's lab should give you some hands-on experience with the difference between an O(1) operation and an O(n) operation.

For a given operation and several values of n, our basic methodology will be to build a vector of length n, measure how long that operation takes for the vector, build a list of length n, and measure how long that operation takes for the list. By choosing five different values for n (10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000), we can then plot our measurements and see empirically how fast or slow a given operation is.

###Getting Started

[Accept the invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/MWR_tSue) to the lab and do git clone to get the files, as usual. Edit the README.md file and share your repo on github.com

### Experiment 0: Vector Subscript

The purpose of this experiment is to get a feel for how to use the Timer class to time the vector subscript operation. This experiment contains a method named `timeAccessAtIndex()` that uses `Timer` to measure how long it takes to access the item at a given index in a vector. The `run()` method calls `timeAccessesForVectorOfSize()` for various vector sizes. This method calls the `timeAccessesAtIndex()` method three times, to see how long it takes to access the first, middle and last value in the vector.

Compile (`make all`) and run `./lab7`.

To report your results, create an online spreadsheet -- either Google Sheets or online Excel. On the worksheet, write `Lab 7: Experiment 0` in the first row; on the next row create column-headings labeled `size`, `first`, `middle`, and `last`. Then add rows for each vector size (i.e., 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000). For each row size, enter the times your program displayed for accessing the first, middle, and last value in the vector of size size.

When you have entered all of your data, create a well-labeled line chart from your timing results. Your chart should look something like this:

![](./imgs/exp0.png)

Note these properties of the graph:

-   The horizontal scale is logarithmic.
-   The vertical lab gives the units.
-   I have chosen to show the values with little circles -- you can choose any shape (circle, square, etc.)

**Analysis.** On the chart shown above, the data are "noisy" (thanks to our imprecise clock), ranging from a low of 30.7667 nsec to a high of 33.6957 nsec. However the lines are basically flat -- there is no significant change to the access time as the vector size increases by orders of magnitudes. If I use the spreadsheet to compute the averages for the first, middle, and last columns, they are all approximately the same. Your chart should be similar. (Note that I ran my tests on my MacBookPro. The values you get on the lab machines may be quite different.)

The relative flatness of these lines and their close proximity to one another indicate that the time to perform this operation remains constant as the size of the vector increases. These results thus indicate empirically that the vector subscript operation is an O(1) (i.e., constant time) operation.

### Experiment 1: Vector & List Appending

In our next experiment, we will use a similar procedure to measure how long it takes to append an item to a vector and compare that with how long it takes to append an item to a list.

In `main.cpp`, comment out the lines referring to `Experiment0` and uncomment the lines referring to `Experiment1`.

In your makefile, replace `Experiment0.cpp` with `Experiment1.cpp` on the 4th line.

Recompile your project (`make all`) and run `./lab7`. As you can see, `Experiment1` contains code to time how long it takes to append a value to a vector. It does this two ways:

1.  It first invokes `timeAppendToVectorOfSize(n)` for varying values of n.
2.  It then uses `timeRepeatedAppendUntilVectorIsSize(n)` to measure the average time an append operation takes as a vector grows very large.

Our timeAppendToVectorOfSize(n) method uses an approach similar to that of Experiment0, but timing how long it takes the vector push_back(item) method to append a single value, By contrast, our timeRepeatedAppendUntilVectorIsSize(n) starts with an empty vector and then times the average length of time to append a value, as push_back() is called repeatedly. Your task is to write two methods that do the same things for lists: timeAppendToListOfSize(n) that can be used to measure the average time to append an item to a list of size n; and timeRepeatedAppendUntilListIsSize(n) that measures the average time an append operation takes as a list grows very large. Using the existing vector methods in Experiment 1 as a model, write these two methods; then compile and run the executable to display the append times for both vectors and lists. When you have good data, return to your spreadsheet. Create a new worksheet, and label the first row Lab 7: Experiment 1. On the next row, place column headings for size, vector, and list. Then add a separate row for each size (10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000). Add your data to your worksheet; then create a chart similar to that of Experiment0. Study your chart. Using it and the data in your spreadsheet, answer the following questions on your spreadsheet, below your chart: What does your data indicate about the time required to append an item to a vector as the vector grows larger? Is the timing behavior produced by timeAppendToVectorOfSize(n) consistent with that of timeRepeatedAppendToVectorOfSize(n)? Explain why or why not. What is the "Big Oh" notation for each? (Remember that our vector's size is increasing exponentially.) What does your data indicate about the time required to append an item to a list as the list grows larger? Is the timing behavior produced by timeAppendToListOfSize(n) consistent with that of timeRepeatedAppendUntilListIsSize(n)? Explain why or why not. What is the "Big Oh" notation for each? What can you conclude about the time required to append an item to a vector compared to a list, as each gets large?

``` cpp
typedef int Item;
```

recompile, and our Vec would be a vector of integers!

This approach works fine for simple problems where all of the vectors store the same types of values. However suppose you need vectors of both integer and real items (or some other type of item) in the same program? In this situation, the typedef approach cannot help us -- we need a different approach.

Part I of today's exercise is to convert our Vec class into a **generic container** -- a container capable of storing any type of item. To do so in C++, we convert the Vec class into a **class template**. Because we have used the typedef-Item approach to define our Vec class, this conversion is fairly simple.

The tests in the provided `tests.cpp` have **not** been revised to use a **Vec template**. You will be changing `Vec.h`, `Vec.cpp`, and `tests.cpp` in today's exercise.

As its name suggests, a **class template** is a plan or blueprint from which the compiler can build a class. Once we have converted our Vec class into a `Vec<Item>` template, a user of the class will be able to write:

``` cpp
Vec<int> v1;
Vec<double> v2;
Vec<string> v3;
```

Given these declarations, the C++ compiler will use the `Vec<Item>` template to build three classes:

1.  A class that is a vector for storing integer values.
2.  Another class that is a vector for storing double values.
3.  Another class that is a vector for storing string values.

The compiler will use these behind-the-scenes classes as the types of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. For every declaration in which we pass a new type into the template, the compiler will build a new class, and then use that class as the declaration's type.

With that as our introduction, let's get on with turning our Vec class into a `Vec<Item>` class template.

### 1. Converting the Class Declaration

The first step in converting a class into a class template is to delete the typedef declaration we used previously -- so remove the line defining `Item` as a double. In its place, we place the phrase `template<class Item>` immediately before the class declaration:

``` cpp
template <class Item>
class Vec {
       ...
};
```

Do this now.

This revised declaration tells the C++ compiler that

1.  What's coming is a class template, not a class.
2.  This template has a single parameter, whose name is Item.
3.  The word class before `Item` indicates that `Item` represents a type, not a variable or object.

It is worth mentioning that the name `Item` is an identifier we have chosen, since it is what we used for our typedef. The words template and class are C++ keywords, they cannot be changed.

Once this declaration has been processed, the name of the template is `Vec<Item>`.

### 2. Eliminating the Implementation File

Because the C++ compiler uses a template as a blueprint from which it builds a class, the compiler needs to be able to see the entire class -- class declaration plus method definitions -- when a program using the template is compiled. This means that the entire class template -- template declaration plus method definitions -- must appear in the header file, in order for a program that `#include`s the header file to compile, or linking errors will occur. So our next step is to select the method definitions in the implementation file, cut them, and paste them into the header file, between the template declaration and the `#endif`.

In `Vec.cpp`, select all of the method definitions, cut them (Ctrl-X or Cmd-X) from the .cpp file. Switch to the `Vec.h`, move the cursor to a point between the end of the template declaration and the `#endif`, and paste them in (using Ctrl-v).

If there are `#include` directives in the `Vec.cpp` file that are **not** in `Vec.h` (except for `Vec.h` itself), they will also need to be cut-and-pasted into `Vec.h`. (It is often necessary to cut-and-paste `#include <iostream>`.)

Now that the method definitions have been moved from `Vec.cpp` to `Vec.h`, you should delete `Vec.cpp` from your project.

::: callout-note
Note that you will need to update your Makefile! Find the `Vec.cpp` reference in the SOURCES line and remove it.
:::

### 3. Converting the Class-Methods to method-templates

We now have a class template, but our methods are still class methods. Our next step is to convert each class method into a template method. Test-driven development gives us a systematic, method-by-method means of doing this conversion, without getting overwhelmed by a zillion compiler errors.

You should see the message indicating there are no tests if you **comment out all of the Vec prototypes**, and \*\*\*\*all of the method definitions you just pasted into the header file\*\* and compile (`make tester`) and run your project(`./tester`). Just remember that your code was drastically changed, and might not function anymore if you don't comment certain parts.

Our test-driven procedure will be to: (don't do this yet -- just read the steps below)

1.  In `tests.cpp`, uncomment the `TEST_CASE`. Convert all uses of Vec to be `Vec<sometype>`. You may choose what type to put in between the \< and \>, but the type should be an integer type -- int, unsigned, short, char, unsigned char, long, etc.
2.  In `Vec.h`, uncomment the corresponding method (i.e., its prototype within the class and its definition outside the class.)
3.  Convert the method's definition into a method-template.
4.  Compile and run the tester.
5.  If any errors are reported, find and fix them;

-   Otherwise, return to step 1.

Converting a method definition (step 3) to a method-template is fairly simple:

1.  Place `template <class Item>` before the beginning of the method's definition.
2.  In the method definition, find each place where the name of the class (e.g., Vec) **is being used as a type** -- each use except when it is being used as the name of an operation like the name of a constructor or destructor -- and replace it with the parameterized name of the template (e.g., `Vec<Item>`).

So the rest of Part I is to use these steps to convert each of the Vec methods to method-templates.

To illustrate this conversion process, let's run through these steps using some of the Vec constructors.

#### 3a. The Default Constructor.

In `tests.cpp`, uncomment the test that tests the default constructor and convert it to use `Vec<sometype>`. (Make sure to uncomment the matching curly brackets (}) at the end of the test case section.) Then switch to `Vec.h` and find the definition of the default constructor. We can perform step 1 by placing `template<class Item>` before the constructor definition:

``` cpp
template<class Item>
Vec::Vec() {
  ...
}
```

That completes step 1.

For step 2, we replace each use of the name of the class (Vec) that is not the name of an operation with the name of the template (`Vec<Item>`), as follows:

``` cpp
template<class Item>
Vec<Item>::Vec() {
  ...
}
```

That's it! Save all changes, and compile and run your tests. If you find errors, find and fix them before continuing.

::: callout-tip
## Hint

You may need to make some additional changes before things build. More than likely, compilation of the tester will not succeed until you have converted several other methods that are used in the default constructor tests, including the destructor.
:::

Congratulations! You have just converted your first class-method into a method-template!

#### 3b. The Explicit-Value Constructor.

Using what we just did to the default constructor as a model, uncomment the explicit constructor's test, fix the types, then convert the explicit constructor into a method-template. Compile and run your project. If errors occur, fix them. When it passes all tests continue.

Note that within this constructor, the allocation of the dynamic array uses `Item`. Previously, this Item was determined by the typedef declaration; but now, Item refers to the name of our template's parameter. If the user declares:

``` cpp
Vec<double> v1;
Vec<int> v2;
```

then in `v1`, all of the occurrences of Item will be replaced by double, while in `v2`, all the occurrences of Item will be replaced by int.

Congratulations! You've just done another method-to-method-template conversion!

#### 3c. The Copy Constructor.

Uncomment and fix the copy constructor's test. In `Vec.h`, find the copy constructor's definition. As before, we place `template<class Item>` before the definition, and replace each occurrence of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation with the name of the template:

``` cpp
template<class Item>
Vec<Item>::Vec(const Vec<Item>& original) {
  ...
}
```

Note that the type of any Vec parameter or local variable must be replaced by `Vec<Item>`. This is consistent with our "conversion rule" -- any use of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation (i.e., a constructor or destructor) must be replaced.

Compile and run your project. Continue when it passes all tests.

#### 3d. The Destructor.

If you have not already done so, convert the destructor to a method-template. Continue when your conversion passes all tests.

#### 3e. The Remaining Operations.

Now that you know how to do the conversion, we can speed up this mechanical process a bit.

At the destructor definition, comment out the line `template<class Item>`. Then copy the line `//template<class Item>`. With the remaining operations still commented out, use Ctrl-v to paste that line at the beginning of each of the remaining operations in the header file.

Return to the destructor's definition and uncomment the line `template<class Item>` in the destructor. Then copy the "phrase" <Item>. With the remaining operations still commented out, paste this after each use of the name of the class that is not the name of an operation, throughout the rest of the header file.

Then, one untested method at a time:

1.  Uncomment the converted method.
2.  Uncomment its corresponding test.
3.  Uncomment the call to that test.
4.  Compile and run the test. When it passes the test, continue to the next untested method.

By using this *methodical* approach (Ha, ha! Get it?!?), any compilation errors that occur should be confined to the newly uncommented method-template. This will make it easier and faster for you to find and fix the errors.

Use this approach to complete the conversion of class `Vec` to the `template Vec<Item>`.

Congratulations! You have just built your first class template!

### Discussion

As you can see, the C++ syntax to build class templates is a bit complicated, and it is quite easy to make syntax errors if you try to build a template container from the outset. For this reason, we recommend this 2-step approach to building containers:

1.  Use the typedef-Item mechanism to build a container class and thoroughly test its operations.
2.  Convert the Item container class into a template that receives its type via a parameter.

By doing so, you can build and test the container in step 1, and debug the logic of its operations. Then (as we have seen today), converting it to a template in step 2 is a mechanical process.

Because **any** type can be passed via the template's parameter, a container built as a template can store any kind of value. Because they are defined to store "generic" items, container templates are often called generic containers. The template is the C++ mechanism for building generic containers; other languages (e.g., Ada, Java) provide other (simpler) mechanisms.

## Part II. Add support for python-like indexing to PyList

Before proceeding, comment out all code in the `tests.cpp` file that runs the tests for Part I -- including the `#include “Vec.h”` statement.

::: callout-note
## NOTE

**Make sure that `catch.hpp` stays included!** And uncomment PyList testing code (i.e., toggle the comments that are there).
:::

The makefile is currently not compiling `PyList.cpp`, so you need to change it. Change the SOURCES line, adding `PyList.cpp`.

::: callout-important
If Vec.cpp is still there, it should be removed at this time.
:::

Look at the `PyList.cpp` and `PyList.h` files.

Build and run. The execution should succeed, testing the existing PyList functionality.

In Python, you can index a list using negative numbers. The last item in the list is at index -1, the second-to-last at -2, etc. The first item in the list, e.g., lst\[0\], is the same as lst\[-10\], if there are 10 items in the list. Here are some examples of how python behaves:

``` python
>>> lst = list(range(10))
>>> lst
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # in this example, the values are the same as the indices
>>> lst[-1]                # last item
9
>>> lst[-8]                # penultimate item
2
>>> lst[-10]               # same as lst[0]
0
>>> lst[-11]               # cannot index off the "front" of the array
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> lst[10]                # cannot index off the end of the array
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

In the `tests.cpp` file, there are already tests for this feature, but they are still commented out. Uncomment them, and run the test. You'll see failures. In fact, you might see a Segmentation Fault.

Now, implement the feature. You'll have to alter `getValue()`, `setValue()`, and `operator[]`, so that the Python-like index is converted to a legal C++ index before accessing `myArray`. Because the code to check for a legal index is the same in those three methods, I put the common code into a new private method called `validate_index(index)`, described in the table below. Then, my whole implementation of `getValue()` becomes very short: `return myArray[validate_index(index)];`

Here is a summary of `validate_index()`:

| **Method** | **Parameters** | **Notes** |
|----|----|----|
| validate_index() | int index | The purpose of this function is to convert what would be a legal python index into a legal C++ index.<br><br>Make note, does this method change anything in our class? If it doesn’t, should we make this a const function?<br><br>**Algorithm:** <br><br>- If the index is \>= n, throw a range_error exception. <br>- If the index is \< -n, throw a range_error exception. <br><br>Convert the index to be between 0 and n-1 if necessary. Return the index back. |

Finally, implement a `find()` method as described below:

| **Method** | **Parameters** | **Notes** |
|----|----|----|
| find() | an Item to search for | If the item is found in the array, return the index. Otherwise, return -1. |

First, add a `SECTION("find")` to the "PyLists" TEST_CASE in `tests.cpp` to test the find command. You'll want to make sure you try to find items that are in a PyList and items that are not in the list. You should also make sure that if an `Item` is in a list more than one time, the index of the first item is returned.

After you are satisfied with your tests, and you prove that your tests fail, then implement the `find()` method.

After you do this and have all your tests passing, then **UNcomment all the Vec tests** in `tests.cpp`, so that ALL tests are now available, both for Vec and for PyList. Then, of course, recompile and run `./tester` to make sure it tests both Vec and PyList.
