## SLOs for Week 10

By the end of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   describe recursion correctly to an elderly ancestor.
-   define the structure of a recursive solution -- base case and recursive case.
-   correctly use the words "winding phase" and "unwinding phase".
-   implement a basic recursive implementation -- e.g., for the factorial function.
-   argue why a recursive solution is generally less efficient than an equivalent iterative solution.
-   describe the role the runtime stack plays in the execution of a recursive function.
-   understand the time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi problem.
